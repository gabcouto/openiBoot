PCF <-> OIF Conversion
----------------------

X11 PCF font files are too heavy-weight to use in OpenIBoot, though many of
the terminal font files we could use is in this format. This utility converts
fixed-width, Terminal pcf fonts to a more compact format I just made up. This
format just has the width and height of each character, and then a bitstream
of the bitmaps of all the characters from 0x00 to 0xff, row by row.

The resulting data is small enough to be included in openiboot after being
passed through bin2c.

I know this code is a mess, but I don't foresee it being used more than once
or twice. Even so, the unpolished code is dumped here for reference.

See the commands themselves for usage.
